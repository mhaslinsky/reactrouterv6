# React Router v5 - 6

project combining last react router project knowledge with firebase to create basic forum-esque site, with user created posts and a rudimentry comment section, all using custom path resloving and the various tools provided by react router.  
Once nearly done with this project however, react router v6 was released. Spent an hour or 2 reading up on the changes and converting this project to v6, even taking advantage of the new nested routes structure and Outlet component.  
deployed @ https://react-router-v6-fun.netlify.app/
